Admin API keys enable Organization Owners to programmatically manage various aspects of their organization, including users, projects, and API keys. These keys provide administrative capabilities, such as creating, updating, and deleting users; managing projects; and overseeing API key lifecycles.

Key Features of Admin API Keys:

- User Management: Invite new users, update roles, and remove users from the organization.

- Project Management: Create, update, archive projects, and manage user assignments within projects.

- API Key Oversight: List, retrieve, and delete API keys associated with projects.

Only Organization Owners have the authority to create and utilize Admin API keys. To manage these keys, Organization Owners can navigate to the Admin Keys section of their API Platform dashboard.

For direct access to the Admin Keys management page, Organization Owners can use the following link:

It's crucial to handle Admin API keys with care due to their elevated permissions. Adhering to best practices, such as regular key rotation and assigning appropriate permissions, enhances security and ensures proper governance within the organization.
