# Create completion

Source: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create

`POST /v1/completions`

Creates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters.

## Request body
### application/json
- `model` (string, required): ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](../models/list.md) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for descriptions of them.
- `prompt` (string | array<string> | array<integer> | array<array<integer>>, required): The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.
  
  Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document. Default: `<|endoftext|>`.
- `best_of` (integer, optional): Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.
  
  When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return – `best_of` must be greater than `n`.
  
  **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`. Default: `1`.
- `echo` (boolean, optional): Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion Default: `False`.
- `frequency_penalty` (number, optional): Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
  
  [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation) Default: `0`.
- `logit_bias` (object, optional): Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
  
  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
  
  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.
- `logprobs` (integer, optional): Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.
  
  The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.
- `max_tokens` (integer, optional): The maximum number of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) that can be generated in the completion.
  
  The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens. Default: `16`.
- `n` (integer, optional): How many completions to generate for each prompt.
  
  **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`. Default: `1`.
- `presence_penalty` (number, optional): Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
  
  [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation) Default: `0`.
- `seed` (integer, optional): If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.
  
  Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.
- `stop` (string | array<string>, optional): Not supported with latest reasoning models `o3` and `o4-mini`.
  
  Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
  returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
- `stream` (boolean, optional): Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions). Default: `False`.
- `stream_options` (object | null, optional)
  - Variant (object):
    - `include_usage` (boolean, optional): If set, an additional chunk will be streamed before the `data: [DONE]`
      message. The `usage` field on this chunk shows the token usage statistics
      for the entire request, and the `choices` field will always be an empty
      array.
      
      All other chunks will also include a `usage` field, but with a null
      value. **NOTE:** If the stream is interrupted, you may not receive the
      final usage chunk which contains the total token usage for the request.
    - `include_obfuscation` (boolean, optional): When true, stream obfuscation will be enabled. Stream obfuscation adds
      random characters to an `obfuscation` field on streaming delta events to
      normalize payload sizes as a mitigation to certain side-channel attacks.
      These obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a small amount
      of overhead to the data stream. You can set `include_obfuscation` to
      false to optimize for bandwidth if you trust the network links between
      your application and the OpenAI API.
- `suffix` (string, optional): The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.
  
  This parameter is only supported for `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`.
- `temperature` (number, optional): What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
  
  We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. Default: `1`.
- `top_p` (number, optional): An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
  
  We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. Default: `1`.
- `user` (string, optional): A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

  - Items:
    - `finish_reason` (string, required): The reason the model stopped generating tokens. This will be `stop` if the model hit a natural stop point or a provided stop sequence,
      `length` if the maximum number of tokens specified in the request was reached,
      or `content_filter` if content was omitted due to a flag from our content filters. Enum: 'stop', 'length', 'content_filter'.
