# output_audio_buffer.cleared

Source: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/output_audio_buffer/cleared

**WebRTC/SIP Only:** Emitted when the output audio buffer is cleared. This happens either in VAD
mode when the user has interrupted (`input_audio_buffer.speech_started`),
or when the client has emitted the `output_audio_buffer.clear` event to manually
cut off the current audio response.
