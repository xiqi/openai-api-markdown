# Create run

Source: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun

`POST /v1/threads/{thread_id}/runs`

Create a run.

## Parameters
- `thread_id` (path, string, required): The ID of the thread to run.
- `include[]` (query, array<string>, optional): A list of additional fields to include in the response. Currently the only supported value is `step_details.tool_calls[*].file_search.results[*].content` to fetch the file search result content.
  
  See the [file search tool documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#customizing-file-search-settings) for more information.

## Request body
### application/json
- `assistant_id` (string, required): The ID of the [assistant](../assistants/index.md) to use to execute this run.
- `model` (string, optional): The ID of the [Model](../models/index.md) to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.
- `reasoning_effort` (string | null, optional)
- `instructions` (string, optional): Overrides the [instructions](../assistants/createAssistant.md) of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.
- `additional_instructions` (string, optional): Appends additional instructions at the end of the instructions for the run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis without overriding other instructions.
- `additional_messages` (array<object>, optional): Adds additional messages to the thread before creating the run.
  - Items:
    - `role` (string, required): The role of the entity that is creating the message. Allowed values include:
      - `user`: Indicates the message is sent by an actual user and should be used in most cases to represent user-generated messages.
      - `assistant`: Indicates the message is generated by the assistant. Use this value to insert messages from the assistant into the conversation. Enum: 'user', 'assistant'.
    - `content` (string | array<object>, required)
    - `attachments` (array<object> | null, optional)
    - `metadata` (object | null, optional)
- `tools` (array<object>, optional): Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.
- `metadata` (object | null, optional)
- `temperature` (number, optional): What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. Default: `1`.
- `top_p` (number, optional): An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
  
  We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. Default: `1`.
- `stream` (boolean, optional): If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a `data: [DONE]` message.
- `max_prompt_tokens` (integer, optional): The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.
- `max_completion_tokens` (integer, optional): The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.
- `truncation_strategy` (object, optional): Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the initial context window of the run.
  - `type` (string, required): The truncation strategy to use for the thread. The default is `auto`. If set to `last_messages`, the thread will be truncated to the n most recent messages in the thread. When set to `auto`, messages in the middle of the thread will be dropped to fit the context length of the model, `max_prompt_tokens`. Enum: 'auto', 'last_messages'.
  - `last_messages` (integer | null, optional)
- `tool_choice` (string | object, optional): Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
  `none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
  `auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
  `required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user.
  Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.
  - Variant (object):
    - `type` (string, required): The type of the tool. If type is `function`, the function name must be set Enum: 'function', 'code_interpreter', 'file_search'.
    - `function` (object, optional)
      - `name` (string, required): The name of the function to call.
- `parallel_tool_calls` (boolean, optional): Whether to enable [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling) during tool use. Default: `True`.
- `response_format` (string | object, optional): Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.
  
  Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
  
  Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
  
  **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.
  - Variant (object):
    - `type` (string, required): The type of response format being defined. Always `text`. Enum: 'text'.
  - Variant (object):
    - `type` (string, required): The type of response format being defined. Always `json_object`. Enum: 'json_object'.
  - Variant (object):
    - `type` (string, required): The type of response format being defined. Always `json_schema`. Enum: 'json_schema'.
    - `json_schema` (object, required): Structured Outputs configuration options, including a JSON Schema.
      - `description` (string, optional): A description of what the response format is for, used by the model to
        determine how to respond in the format.
      - `name` (string, required): The name of the response format. Must be a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or contain
        underscores and dashes, with a maximum length of 64.
      - `schema` (object, optional): The schema for the response format, described as a JSON Schema object.
        Learn how to build JSON schemas [here](https://json-schema.org/).
      - `strict` (boolean | null, optional)
