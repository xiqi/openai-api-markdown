## Request body
### application/json
- `model` (string, required): The name of the model to fine-tune. You can select one of the
  [supported models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning#which-models-can-be-fine-tuned).
- `training_file` (string, required): The ID of an uploaded file that contains training data.
  
  See [upload file](../files/create.md) for how to upload a file.
  
  Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file. Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose `fine-tune`.
  
  The contents of the file should differ depending on if the model uses the [chat](chat-input.md), [completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) format, or if the fine-tuning method uses the [preference](preference-input.md) format.
  
  See the [fine-tuning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization) for more details.
- `hyperparameters` (object, optional): The hyperparameters used for the fine-tuning job.
  This value is now deprecated in favor of `method`, and should be passed in under the `method` parameter. Deprecated.
  - `batch_size` (string | integer, optional): Number of examples in each batch. A larger batch size means that model parameters
    are updated less frequently, but with lower variance. Default: `auto`.
  - `learning_rate_multiplier` (string | number, optional): Scaling factor for the learning rate. A smaller learning rate may be useful to avoid
    overfitting. Default: `auto`.
  - `n_epochs` (string | integer, optional): The number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle
    through the training dataset. Default: `auto`.
- `suffix` (string, optional): A string of up to 64 characters that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.
  
  For example, a `suffix` of "custom-model-name" would produce a model name like `ft:gpt-4o-mini:openai:custom-model-name:7p4lURel`.
- `validation_file` (string, optional): The ID of an uploaded file that contains validation data.
  
  If you provide this file, the data is used to generate validation
  metrics periodically during fine-tuning. These metrics can be viewed in
  the fine-tuning results file.
  The same data should not be present in both train and validation files.
  
  Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file. You must upload your file with the purpose `fine-tune`.
  
  See the [fine-tuning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization) for more details.

      - `project` (string, required): The name of the project that the new run will be created under.
      - `name` (string, optional): A display name to set for the run. If not set, we will use the Job ID as the name.

        like associated with the run. If not set, the default entity for the registered WandB API key is used.
      - `tags` (array<string>, optional): A list of tags to be attached to the newly created run. These tags are passed through directly to WandB. Some
        default tags are generated by OpenAI: "openai/finetune", "openai/{base-model}", "openai/{ftjob-abcdef}".
